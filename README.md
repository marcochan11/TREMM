## Overview
TREMM is a Discord bot built for CSS 360 to help users plan trips without leaving the chat. It provides travel tools like weather lookups, activities, restaurants, flights, hotels, rental cars, and full trip planning through Discord slash commands.

TREMM 2.1 expands on the original bot by improving trip planning, adding hotel watchlists and trip-saving features, strengthening validation, improving command guidance, and making the bot more useful for real travel workflows.

## What's New in v2.1

### New Commands
- **`/watchlist`** — save hotels you are interested in for later viewing
- **`/help`** — explains how the bot works and gives usage details for each command
- **`/savedtrips`** — view your previously saved trip briefs
- **`/deletetrip`** — delete a saved trip by trip ID
- **`/rentalcars`** — find rental car options for a location

### Enhanced Features
- **`/tripbrief` save option** — users can now choose to save a generated trip brief
- Saved trips are stored in both **`.txt`** and **`.json`** formats for readability and structured reuse
- **`/newhotels`** now supports more specific destinations such as `"Newport Beach"` instead of only broader cities like `"Los Angeles"`
- **`/flights`** now prevents users from entering the same airport for both origin and destination
- **`/flights`** includes clearer validation and error messages
- Added a **Google Flights booking link/button** to flight results
- Enhanced **`/restaurants`** for better discovery and output quality

### Reliability and UX Improvements

## Saved Trip Storage
When a user saves a trip brief, TREMM stores the trip in two formats:

- **`.json`** — structured format for reuse, parsing, or future extensions

This makes saved trips both user-friendly and developer-friendly.

## Project Goal
TREMM is designed to make trip planning easier, faster, and more collaborative inside Discord. Instead of switching between multiple travel sites and apps, users can search, compare, save, and manage trip information directly in chat using slash commands.

TREMM 2.1 pushes the project closer to a more complete travel assistant by combining trip discovery, trip storage, hotel tracking, and improved booking workflows into one bot.
